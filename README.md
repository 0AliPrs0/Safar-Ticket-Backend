# ‚úàÔ∏è SafarTicket - Backend & API

## üåü Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the **SafarTicket Backend Server**, developed for Phase 3 of the project. This phase focuses on the implementation of a secure and scalable server using **Django**, which exposes a full suite of **RESTful APIs** for client-side applications to consume. The backend handles user authentication, travel searching, ticket reservation, and administrative tasks, all while interacting directly with a **MySQL** database and using **Redis** for caching. The entire infrastructure is containerized with **Docker** for easy setup and deployment.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup & Installation
The entire backend environment is managed by Docker and Docker Compose, eliminating manual dependency management.

### **Prerequisites**
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)

### **Installation Steps**
1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/0AliPrs0/Safar-Ticket-Backend.git](https://github.com/0AliPrs0/Safar-Ticket-Backend.git)
    cd Safar-Ticket-Backend
    ```

2.  **Build and Run Containers:**
    This single command will build the necessary images and start all services (`db`, `redis`, `backend`, `cron`).
    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build -d
    ```
The backend server will be accessible at `http://localhost:8000`.

---

## üîß Configuration & Security
All necessary configurations are defined within `docker-compose.yml`.

- **Services:**
  - `db` (MySQL): The database password and name are set via environment variables. The `init.sql` script is automatically executed on the first run to initialize the schema and data.
  - `redis`: Used for caching and OTP storage.
  - `backend`: The Django application server.
  - `cron`: A dedicated container to run periodic tasks, such as cleaning up expired reservations.


---

## üöÄ Running the Project
After executing `docker-compose up`, the backend API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

- **View Service Logs:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose logs -f
  ```

- **Stop All Services:**
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```

## ‚úÖ Design Notes
- **Stateless Authentication:** The API uses **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** for authentication, ensuring the backend remains stateless and scalable.
- **Single Responsibility:** Each API endpoint is designed to perform one specific task, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle for clean and maintainable code.
- **Direct SQL Queries:** As per project requirements, the backend avoids using Django's ORM. All database interactions are performed using raw, parameterized SQL queries through the `MySQLdb` library to prevent SQL injection.
- **Performance:** **Redis** is used strategically to cache frequently accessed data, such as the list of cities and search results, significantly reducing database load and improving response times.
- **Cron Job:** A separate container runs a cron job to periodically execute `cancel_expired_reservations.py`, which cleans up stale reservations and releases seats, ensuring data integrity.
